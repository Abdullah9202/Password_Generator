I've created a password generator in python that uses random module to generate easy as well as complex password according to the user's choice. After Executing the program it will ask the user to input the number of characters in the password, then it asks for the symbols and number that are to be included in the password and then finally generate two password. One will be the easy password and other will be the hard password.
